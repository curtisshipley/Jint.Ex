<h1>JintSetTimeoutDemo</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The sample shows how to implement setTimeOut() function in Jint and is my first
step at building a layer around Jint, to execute JavaScript program in background
in relation with a UI (Windows WinForm and iOS UI).</p>

<p>The purpose of class <strong><em>AsyncronousEngine</em></strong> is to 
* Wait script in a background thread
* Allow communication with the UI and UI Controls
* Execute __setTimeout__ call back</p>
